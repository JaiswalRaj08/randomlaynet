# RanLayNet: A Dataset for Document Layout Detection used for Domain Adaptation and Generalization

## INTRODUCTION

* Current layout detection datasets for deep learning lack diversity, necessitating a large number of annotated instances for training, resulting in high costs and time demands.
* Proposing RanLayNet, a synthetic document dataset with auto-assigned labels for layout elements, addressing challenges by offering a versatile dataset for robust model training across diverse document formats.
* Developed domain adaptation for layout identification using limited labeled data, improving a deep model trained on RanLayNet compared to models using only real documents.
